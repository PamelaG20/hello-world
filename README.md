# hello-world
My first repository


Hey Humans! 

Im sure hoping this is the right way to do this,

Im an interesting individual. I love the indoors and staying up late while drinking coffee watching random netflix shows. 
I'm new to coding/programming. I just got a handle on HTML and CSS. Now comes the toughest part from what I heard. JAVASCRIPT. 

I'm hoping to collaborate and meet like-minded friends. I want to learn as much as I can about the coding world and eventually become a web developer. Reach out if you think we could chat about some code! Thanks for reviewing!
